Please list the name of your .PY file here

e.g. Tutors.py -- Args: Tutor number, name, surname, room number, students assigned.

gui.py and quota -- lilis code, the gui has simple buttons and navigation but doesnt carry out an functions as i dont know how to do that. 
quota works on comandline as i cant carry out the gui work until i get the database. 


new.py - opens a csv distributes into 5 lists afterwords sorts them( figured why not sort them before putting them in saves some headache)
then puts them into the database

displaytutees.py - Al - needs a search arg to give it a tutor ID, then makes a list of said tutors tutees
